# ðŸ“„ Makefile Tutorial

## Introduction
A Makefile is a script used by the `make` utility to automate the build process in software projects. It simplifies managing dependencies and builds targets efficiently, which is particularly useful for C/C++ projects but can be used in many others as well.

This guide will cover the essentials of Makefile, variables, automatic variables, and some of the most useful built-in functions to make your project automation more efficient.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Basic Makefile Structure

A Makefile is written with **targets**, **dependencies**, and **commands**:

```makefile
target: dependencies
    commands
```

### Example:
```makefile
my_program: main.o utils.o
    gcc -o my_program main.o utils.o
```

- `my_program` is the target.
- It depends on `main.o` and `utils.o`.
- The command (`gcc -o my_program main.o utils.o`) is executed to build `my_program`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Variables in Makefile

Variables store values, such as compiler options, filenames, etc., and are referenced using `$(...)`.

### Example:
```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall

my_program: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o my_program main.o utils.o
```

In this example, `CC` holds the compiler (`gcc`) and `CFLAGS` stores compiler flags (`-Wall`).

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Pattern Rules

Pattern rules allow you to define generic commands for files with specific extensions, making your Makefile more flexible.

### Example:
```makefile
%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

This pattern rule transforms `.c` files into `.o` object files:
- `$<` refers to the first dependency (the `.c` file).
- `$@` refers to the target (the `.o` file).

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Automatic Variables

Here are a few automatic variables often used in Makefiles:
- `$@`: The target name.
- `$<`: The first dependency.
- `$^`: All dependencies.

### Example:
```makefile
my_program: main.o utils.o
    gcc -o $@ $^
```

In this case, `$@` expands to `my_program`, and `$^` expands to `main.o utils.o`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Phony Targets

A **phony** target is a target that is not the name of a file. It's commonly used for tasks such as cleaning up build files.

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f *.o my_program
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Built-in Functions

Makefiles provide a set of built-in functions to help with file and string manipulation. Here are some of the most useful ones:

### 6.1 `wildcard`
The `wildcard` function retrieves files that match a pattern.
```makefile
SRC = $(wildcard *.c)
```

### 6.2 `patsubst`
The `patsubst` function replaces patterns in file names.
```makefile
OBJECTS = $(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(SRC))
```

### 6.3 `addprefix`
Adds a prefix to each word in a list.
```makefile
OBJ_DIR = obj/
OBJECTS = $(addprefix $(OBJ_DIR), file1.o file2.o file3.o)
```

### 6.4 `addsuffix`
Adds a suffix to each word in a list.
```makefile
SRC_FILES = main utils io
C_FILES = $(addsuffix .c, $(SRC_FILES))
```

### 6.5 `subst`
Performs text substitution within variables.
```makefile
OBJS = file1.o file2.o file3.o
OBJS_NEW = $(subst .o,.obj,$(OBJS))
```

### 6.6 `sort`
Sorts a list and removes duplicates.
```makefile
OBJECTS = $(sort file2.o file1.o file2.o file3.o)
```

### 6.7 `filter` and `filter-out`
Filters out or keeps items in a list based on a pattern.
```makefile
SOURCES = main.c utils.c io.c
OBJ_FILES = $(filter %.o, $(SOURCES))
```

### 6.8 `findstring`
Checks if a string contains another string.
```makefile
ifeq ($(findstring debug,$(CFLAGS)),debug)
CFLAGS += -g
endif
```

### 6.9 `dir`, `notdir`, `basename`, `suffix`
- `dir`: Extracts the directory part of a file name.
- `notdir`: Strips the directory from file names.
- `basename`: Removes file extensions.
- `suffix`: Extracts the file extension.

```makefile
FILE = src/main.c
DIR = $(dir $(FILE))          # Outputs: src/
FILENAME = $(notdir $(FILE))  # Outputs: main.c
BASENAME = $(basename $(FILE))# Outputs: src/main
EXT = $(suffix $(FILE))       # Outputs: .c
```

### 6.10 `shell`
Executes a shell command and captures its output.
```makefile
DATE = $(shell date)
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Advanced Example

Hereâ€™s an advanced Makefile example that showcases pattern rules, built-in functions, and variables:

```makefile
SRC = $(wildcard src/*.c)
OBJ = $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC))
OBJ_DIR = obj/

all: $(addprefix $(OBJ_DIR),$(notdir $(OBJ)))

$(OBJ_DIR)%.o: src/%.c
    mkdir -p $(OBJ_DIR)
    gcc -c $< -o $@

clean:
    rm -rf $(OBJ_DIR)
```

### Breakdown:
- `wildcard`: Finds all `.c` files in the `src/` directory.
- `patsubst`: Converts the `.c` files to `.o` files.
- `addprefix`: Adds the `obj/` directory to each object file.
- `notdir`: Removes directory paths, only leaving the filenames.

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Conclusion

Makefile is a powerful tool for automating your build process, and mastering it will save you time, especially in managing dependencies. By using variables, built-in functions, and automatic variables, you can create efficient, maintainable Makefiles for any project.
